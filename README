Question1:

Bad XML
Create an RDD of Post objects where each Post is a valid row of XML from
the Cross-Validated (stats.stackexchange.com) allPosts data set.

Return the total number of XML rows that started with <row that were subsequently 
rejected during your processing. 

** Note that the text is unicode, and contains non-ASCII characters. 
You may need to re-encode to UTF-8 (depending on your XML parser)

Question2:

Look to see if there is a relationship between the number of times the post was 
upvoted minus the number of times it was downvoted, so it is a measure of 
how much a post was liked. We'd expect posts with higher number of favorites to 
have better scores, since they're both measurements of how good the post is.

Let's aggregate post by the number of favorites, and find the average score for 
each number of favorites. Do this for the lowest 50 number of favorites.
